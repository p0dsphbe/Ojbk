　　《中国陶瓷（英文版）》介绍：china is richly endowed with the raw materials needed for making ceramics. chinese discovered and mastered the techniques of porcelain first. ceramic products are not only an important cultural heritage of human civilization; they are still very much a part of everyone's lives， and in a very lively and colorful way. a beautifully crafted and tastefully formed ceramic piece not only is a fruit of the technology and craft of its times， it also records the bits of history and life. sometimes， it can even carry paintings， poetry， calligraphy， sculpture all on its tiny body; or serve as a medium of information for society.
