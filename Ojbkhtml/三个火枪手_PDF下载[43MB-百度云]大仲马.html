He had come to Paris  without money or connections. The only thing he brought with him was his bravery， great skill with a sword， and a quick mind. After many years his fame grew and， eventually， he became one of the King's most trusted servants. Louis xm trusted Mister Treville perhaps even more than he trusted the Prime Minister or even his own wife. He made Treville the captain of his guards - the Musketeers.　　Mister Treville was the third most powerful man in France at this time. Cardinal Richelieu was the second； he was the Prime Minister of France. Cardinal Richelieu had great influence with the King， who listened to his advice closely. Both the King and the Cardinal had a group of armed bodyguards. The two men were both very competitive and they each tried to find the best swordsmen. The King's guards were called the Musketeers； they were all brave men who did not fear death. Richelieu's men were called simply the Cardinal's Guards.　　The Cardinal needed loyal guards because he had many powerful enemies. One of his enemies was the Queen-Anne of Austria-she feared the Cardinal's power and his influence over her husband， the King.　　The second was Mister Treville. He would often have his Musketeers train in front of the Cardinal's house to show off their strength. This always made the Cardinal red with anger.　　D'Artagnan found his way to the Musketeer's camp early that day. The camp was full of men， all wearing the traditional uniform of the Musketeers.　　They all carried sword and were standing in groups talking and laughing.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《床头灯英语·3000词读物（纯英文）：三个火枪手》主要内容包括Leaving Home，The Missing Letter，Meeting Mister Treville，Three Duels，Meeting the King，Mister Bonacieux，The Duke of Buckingham，The Man with the Scar，Making the Trap，Making a Plan，Rush to the Coast，London，The Queen's Party，Capture!，The Rescue Plan，The Race to the Convent，The Man in Red，The Trial，The Execution，The Cardinal's Messenger。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
