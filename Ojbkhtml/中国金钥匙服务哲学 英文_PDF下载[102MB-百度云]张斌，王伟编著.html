Golden Key Service, as a diamond in the crown of services, was introduced in China’s hospitality industry in 1995. In the same year, Golden Key in China received the world’s richest man and philanthropist, Bill Gates.  <br/>In 2008, Golden Key in China was the only organization to be invited to provide services to the athletes and journalists of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.  <br/>During the G20 Summit in Hangzhou in 2016, Golden Key China provided excellent hospitality for the heads of State who attended the Summit.  <br/>The service collaboration network now covers 260 Chinese cities, involving over 2,000 Golden Key members.
