"16+1 Cooperation" is a new platform for cooperation, as well as a new initiative. The redefinition of the "16+1 Cooperation" to this region is not to create an exclusive identification for the CEEC, but to add another connotation and provide an opportunity for cooperation for them in the international affairs, with no strings attached. "16+1 Cooperation" is an innovation and breakthrough for the sub-regional cooperation, displaying distinct feature of the time and revealing new opportunities for win-win cooperation.　　Secondly, "16+1 Cooperation" demonstrates a sincere wish to build a community of shared future for mankind. It is set up in the context of worldwide financial crisis and uncertain economic recovery. Both China and CEEC have an urgent demand for opening new marketsand developing new trade partnership. Chinese president Xi Jinping pointed out that, China and EU have become a community of shared future with highly integrated interests at the age of economic globalization. Therefore, "16+1 Cooperation" will be the vital pivot and important breakthrough of the building of the China-EU community of shared future. The China-CEEC cooperation was once the weakest part of China-EU relations in bilateral relations and in economic and trade cooperation. However, through all-round, wide-ranging multi-level and mutually beneficial cooperation, now "16+1 Cooperation" has becomes an important growth pole for China-EU cooperation, advancing the China-CEEC cooperation to a community of shared future in which both sides together overcome the global economic crisis and achieve common prosperity.　　Thirdly, "16+1 Cooperation" sticks to the core idea of win-win cooperation. It always adheres to ideas of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit and win-win cooperation, and that explains why the 16 CEEC widely accept and actively join in the "16+1 Cooperation". In the past five years, "16+1 Cooperation" has made numerous achievements: the connectivity and infrastructure in CEECs are developed rapidly, the economic and trade cooperation between China and CEEC continues to rise compared to the western European countries. Even though, skeptics still doubt the concept of win-win cooperation raised by Chinese side due to the imbalanced economic volume. We shall emphasize that win-win cooperation is neither a zero-sum game nor half to half share. Because of the asymmetry of the economic volume and market size between China and CEEC as well as the dissimilarity and difference within CEEC, it is unrealistic for each country to equally distribute the interests in every projects of the "16+1 Cooperation". It can be called a win-win cooperation as long as there are no loss on both sides and does not cause any harm to a third party. The major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics adheres to the ethics of legitimate justice and reasonable benefit, advocates pursuing justice and benefits simultaneously and always puts the justice above the benefits. It is possible for China to give up part of the economic interests to promote "16+1 Cooperation", which is in accordance with the good tradition of Chinese diplomacy and China's responsibilities and roles as a great power in international affairs. Since the Belt and Road initiative was proposed by China, the principle of win-win cooperation has further advanced toward the global govemance ideas of "wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits". It means that all the participants not only work　　together and share the results, but also discuss the rules together and participate jointly, truly realizing the goal of equality and mutual benefit. China welcomes the 16 CEE countries to take part in the development of the Belt and Road Initiative and the "16+1 Cooperation" on the basis of these spirits, because it will not only bring common development and prosperity, but also provide "16+1 Cooperation" with a stronger foundation and a broader platform.　　Fourthly, "16+1 Cooperation" expands China's network of global partnerships. It opens up a new way to develop relations with traditional friend countries. For the last five years, China's relations with Poland and Serbia have been respectively upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership, while the strategic partnership with the Czech Republic and the comprehensive strategic partnership with Hungary were also established. More importantly, the bilateral relations and level of mutual trust between China and CEE countries are greatly enhanced through all kinds of meetings under the framework of the "16+1 Cooperation". The partnership advocated by China is characterized by equality, peace and inclusiveness, with no classification of major or subordinate countries, no split of different blocs, no imaginary enemies and no targeting at any third party. So it's neither reasonable nor necessary for some European think tanks to worry about that China is dividing EU by promoting "16+1　　Cooperation". Although China is the first advocator of the "16+1 Cooperation", China insists all parties involved are equal and shall discuss and construct together, instead of seeking a higher status than others. At the same time, "16+1 Cooperation", like the Belt and Road Initiative, endows great openness and inclusiveness. They are open to the third party, thus helping China to make numerous new friends. Following the road of peaceful development, China advocates dialogue rather than confrontation and establishes partnerships rather than alliances.　　Last but not least, China regards "16+1 Cooperation" as part of and positive complement to the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership from the very beginning, boosting the reciprocal cooperation between China and Europe through enhancing the cooperation between China and the 16 CEE countries.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　“16＋1合作”于自2012年建立启动以来，经过5年多的不断发展日益成为中国与中东欧国家在各领域合作交流的重要平台。中东欧国家方面，目前，16个中东欧国家中已有11个成为了欧盟成员国，而其剩余的5个中东欧国家也把加入欧盟作为重要国策和未来发展方向。这使得中国与中东欧国家开展合作时必须考虑与欧盟的关系因素。事实上，“16＋1合作”与中欧合作密不可分，中国政府自发起“16＋1合作”框架之始就强调该合作平台是中欧关系、中欧合作的重要内容和有益补充。正如2016年中国—中东欧国家领导人里加峰会上，中国总理李克强所指出的：“16＋1合作”是中欧合作的组成部分和有益补充，有利于推进中欧四大伙伴关系和五大平台建设，有利于欧洲平衡发展，有利于欧洲一体化。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
