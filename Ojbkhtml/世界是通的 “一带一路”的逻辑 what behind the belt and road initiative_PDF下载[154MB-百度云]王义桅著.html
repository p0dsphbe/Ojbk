In fact, the gap between rich and poor and serious misunderstanding among people are the pressing challenges facing all countries; we have taken globalization for granted. As a matter of fact, the so-called globalization is more of the partial globalization of coastal areas and developed groups. Today, the size of modern population has upgraded from the initial tens of millions in Europe and hundreds of millions in the United States, to billions in emerging countries. The sea routes opened up by Europe and rules set up by the U.S. alone can no longer support such a big size of population.Against this backdrop, China put forward a great proposal “the Belt and Road Initiative,” which has injected more Chinese elements to the ancient Silk Road, and kept it in line with our times and the needs of the people. Demonstrating China’s willingness to shoulder its due responsibilities in its rise. This initiative can well be called the second great geographical discovery. It also indicates that the revival of civilization rather than a one-directional and one-dimensional globalization is the trend of the world. The five dimensions of connectivity, namely, policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bond, are the roots to shape humanity’s community of common future, truly promote inclusive globalization, achieve universal and balanced globalization and make globalization strike roots around the world. This concept of connectivity will not only help plan paths for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, but also help more countries shake off poverty, creating a new model of regional and global cooperation in the 21st century.This book explains the logic concerning globalization, civilization, strategy, economy, politics and diplomacy in an in-depth yet understandable way, and reveals the Chinese wisdom and global wisdom displayed by the Belt and Road Initiative.
