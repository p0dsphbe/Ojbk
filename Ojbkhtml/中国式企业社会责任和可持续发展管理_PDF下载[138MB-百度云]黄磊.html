	　　through comprehensive literature review of csr,sustainability and stakeholder theory, and the complimentary study of a large chinese business that has been successful in applying these concepts within the chinese context, the author has confirmed the importance of dealing with the context-based features of these concepts when applied within china.critically, the author also found that implementation cannot be piecemeal but requires an approach that embraces the whole management, leadership and operating systems of the organisation. the book examines the doctrines of confucianism, daoism and buddhism concluding that these doctrines provide supporting foundations for successful csr and sustainability initiatives in china. the core element of this process is a human centred harmonious organisational culture driven by visionary leadership.a sustainable business should strive to balance its economic objectives with the requirements of human beings, including the requirements of the ecology.some suggestions on prevailing csr and sustainability management models in the west have also been proposed.
