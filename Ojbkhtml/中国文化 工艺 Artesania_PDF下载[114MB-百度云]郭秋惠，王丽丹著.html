Each book introduces the history of a field or theme and the same origin of Chinese culture reflected by it, pursues its existence and manifestation in Chinese people’s life today, tells those “unknown stories” through smooth and relaxing words and exquisite pictures, reveals Chinese people’s thinking habits, behavioral modes, traditional concepts and social life, and helps readers understand “what Chinese people are like and what their thinking modes and living customs are.”As the old saying goes, “Each place has its own way of supporting its own inhabitants.” For China, an agricultural country backed by the agriculture and handcraft industry in the history, is nowadays permeated with traditional lifestyles originated and derived from the natural conditions in farming society. As an outcome of people’s life and customs, an enormous variety of traditional handcrafts are anchored among the folk. Characterized by cultural features differing from other birthplaces of civilization, such practical, simple and warmhearted arts have always demonstrated China’s national economy and people’s livelihood from ancient to modern times. Speaking of court crafts serving rich and powerful ones, scholar-bureaucrat crafts highlighting the fun of literati and folk crafts spilling local flavor, all the intentions to invent and create have come from Chinese’s daily needs in certain natural conditions. All of these crafts, acting as the important carrier of Chinese civilization, contain the wisdom of creation accumulated during production and life.

Crafts depend on skills, as the weather relies on seasons, the earth on the weather, and the material on appearance. Traditional Chinese arts and crafts have won good reputations in the international community in the history of material culture. In thousands of years, craftsmanship has been developed in people’s life and production activities. Originally, all varieties of crafts were made for practical purpose, so they were practical, simple, user-friendly, and adaptive to agricultural progress. Even royal crafts and scholar crafts, the pinnacle of crafts, retained the practical and simple features. They are rich cultural heritages left to us, containing people’s creation and wisdom in life. </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>郭秋惠，1979年生，毕业于清华大学美术学院艺术史论系。文学博士，清华大学美术学院艺术史论系教师、中国工艺美术学会理论委员会会员。主要从事中国工艺与设计的历史与理论研究。发表论文及访谈30余篇，出版的著作有：《中国传统工艺》（合著）、《追逐太阳的光影•邓伟》（合编）、《中国现代艺术与设计学术思想丛书•吴劳文集》、《传统与学术：清华大学美术学院院史访谈录》（合编）、《光华路：中央工艺美术学院影存1956—1999》（合编）等。王丽丹，1978年生，毕业于清华大学美术学院艺术史论系。文学博士，中原工学院艺术设计学院教师、中国工艺美术学会理论委员会会员。主要从事中外设计历史与理论研究。发表论文及访谈20余篇，出版的著作有：《中国现代艺术与设计学术思想丛书•邱陵文集》、《传统与学术：清华大学美术学院院史访谈录》（主要撰稿人）、《清华大学美术学院简史》（主要撰稿人）、《艺术鉴赏》（合编）等。Guo Qiuhui, born in 1979, graduated from the Department of Art History of the Academy of Arts   Design of Tsinghua University.
