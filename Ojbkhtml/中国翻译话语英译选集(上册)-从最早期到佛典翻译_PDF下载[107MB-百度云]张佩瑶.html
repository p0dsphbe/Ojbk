  插图：spiritual forms, and as remarks about taste, preferences, and constraints. The passages are framed by annotations and commentaries. The annotations provide historical, textual, contextual and other information to facilitate understanding of the passages translated. The commentaries at the end of each passage highlight links between entries and give the present editor's comments on the ideas expressed in them. Both the annotations and the commentaries are presented in terms of contemporary concerns and preoccupations. This present-day voice interweaves with voicesfrom the past to set into motion a dialogic operation predicated upon the belief that there is no"innocent" writing. The Buddhist project of the past was rooted in ideology, just as the presentanthology is driven by the ideology of the editor. It is an ideology of intervention that works ontwo fronts. First, it seeks to make available for study a major non-western perspective from whichto look at general, technical or theoretical issues relating to translation, and thereby to promote aninternational translation studies, one that is less limited by the Eurocentric mode that dominatesthe present scene. Second, it seeks to re-root/re-route the development of translation studies in China by producing a work of translation through which researchers unfamiliar with classical Chinese can acquaint themselves with traditional writings about translation - a circuitous path, no doubt, but important for opening new possibilities for development？II. OVERALL TRANSLATION POLICYThe overall translation policy is informed by the editor's view that this particular anthology high-lights translation as a form of cultural representation, and not merely as a process ofinterlingualcommunication. The aim is to achieve what Kwame Anthony Appiah calls "thick translation",that is a way of translating that can promote in the target language culture a fuller understand-ing of and a deeper respect for the culture of the Other. For the present anthology, whose editorand translators are all Chinese, thick translation takes the form of self-representation rather thanrepresentation of the Other, and is aimed at promoting in the target language culture a fullerunderstanding of and a deeper respect for Chinese culture.iv~ For a fuller exposition ofthe ideology ofintervention which this anthology is meant to serve, see Martha RY.Cheung, "Representation, intervention and mediation: a translation anthologist's reflections on the complexitiesof translating China" （Cheung forthcoming a）. For a discussion of the related issue of why the articulation ofideological position is important, see Martha P.Y. Cheung, "Politics of representation: a translation anthologist'sself-examination" （Cheung 2005a）. For a more detailed mapping of the directions for theoretical developments in the discipline of translation studies on the Chinese mainland, see Martha P.Y. Cheung, "A few suggestionsfor the development of Chinese theoretical discourse on translation"对中国译理论建设的几点建义Zhongguo yixue lilun fianshe de fidian fianyi, Cheung 2004）.The term "thick translation" was first used by Kwame Anthony Appiah, who invented the expression as avariation of the term "thick description" popularized by the ethnographer Clifford Geertz, who in turn borrowedit from the philosopher Gilbert Ryle. Ryle the philosopher is interested in "the thinking of thought", and "thickdescription" is a mode of description aimed at articulating the "immense though unphotographable differences"between acts and behavionr that are apparently similar or identical （Ryle 1971:480）. Geertz applies Ryle's insightto ethnographical work, and emphasizes that "thick description" should be used for observing, understanding,interpreting, describing, and "inscribing" another culture in writing （Geertz 1973:19）. "Thick description", ac-cording to Geertz, is not the same as total description and, because of its interpretive nature, it is always partialand incomplete, though more adequate and more thorough than "thin" or "less thick" descriptions. Appiah, inturn, develops his notion of "thick translation" from Geertz's "thick description". To him, "thick translation"serves a specific political and pedagogical purpose, and that is to promote in the target language culture a fullerunderstanding of and a genuinely informed respect for the cultures of others （Appiah 2000:427）.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
