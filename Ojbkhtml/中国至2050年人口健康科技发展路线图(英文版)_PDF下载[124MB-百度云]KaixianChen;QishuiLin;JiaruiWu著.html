The rapid development in science and technology exerts an unprecedented influence upon the field of public health. Progress made in the life science allows traditional medicine to develop into biomedicines. In the 21st century, life science, material science, information science, cognition science, complexity science and so on will all be integrated to breed major scientific breakthrough, thus bringing about important changes in the field of public health.<br/>As a country with the largest population, China will still emphasize "birth control" measures as its basic national population policy. In terms of birth control,the present contraception methods alone are not good enough. Thus, we have to strengthen the basic research on reproductive medicine and further improve Chinas research system of reproductive science and reproductive health.<br/></p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
