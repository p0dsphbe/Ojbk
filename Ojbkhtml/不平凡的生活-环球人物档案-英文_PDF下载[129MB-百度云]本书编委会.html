His hope was to go deep into local people's lives. He got the chance to work as an unpaid volunteer for a local art troupe in Ruoqiang County instead of Kashgar, the hometown of muqam that he had dreamed about.　　"They told me that I'd better not make Kashgar my first stop, since it has a lot of ethnic groups and I would have problems communicating with the locals without being able to speak Uyghur," Wang said.　　"It takes time to know a place and its people," Wang said. At first, he found it hard to get accustomed to his environment, but he took his time. Besides investigating music, he taught English at a primary school and also wrote music and musical plays for the troupe.　　18 months later, he was able to speak Uyghur and mix freely with the locals.　　"If you love the culture of a place enough, you will naturally leam its language. It is a very natural thing," Wang said.　　He developed a deep feeling for Ruoqiang and saw it as his hometown in Xinjiang. When he came to Shache County, he realized that it would have been impossible to live there had he not learned Uyghur.　　In Shache County, Wang worked as a volunteer for a muqam inheritance center and gained first-hand experience with the musical form and local folk artists. There, he decided to record artists performing their traditional music and visited over 20 townships across the county and went on to places like Yili, Hotan, Altay, and Turpan that are famous for their folk songs.　　Good Brother　　Wang now boasts more than 15,000 fans on his Sina Weibo account and many of them are Uyghurs. Touched by Wang's dedication to protecting their music, some call Wang "a good brother for Xinjiang."　　Ilhamjan Muhemmed, a senior college student and music lover, said he admires Wang greatly for his efforts in protecting the music of Xinjiang.　　"He shows great respect for our culture and music. I think he deserves double respect from me. Besides, he is a brave guy," Ilhamjan Muhemmed told the Global 77mes.　　After living in Xinjiang for so long, Wang said that he seldom feels any novelty, as he has already become a part of the region. "Today, what I value most about my Xinjiang experience is that I have made many friends there and managed to learn about their characteristics," Wang said. "Then comes its culture, muqam and folk songs."　　"The people in Xinjiang have made me fall in love with this place. They are genuine," he added.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《不平凡的生活（环球人物档案 英文版）》内容选自《环球时报》英文版的人物专栏中29位典型中国人物的事迹，分为社会、校园、文化、科技四章，向读者展现了来自中国各行各业的人士，他们有的乐于挑战，有的勇于追逐常人嘲笑的梦想，有的关注农民工利益，有的致力于维护民族团结。　　《不平凡的生活（环球人物档案 英文版）》通过对这些人物的描写，刻画了当今中国的社会百态。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
