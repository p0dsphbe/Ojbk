                         ——顾颉刚
论方面广阔，述作宏富，且能深入为文者，我常推崇吕思勉（诚之）先生、陈垣（援庵）先生、陈寅恪先生与钱穆（宾四）先生为前辈史学四大家。
                        ——严耕望</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
吕思勉先生是举世公认一生读书*多的伟大史学家，尤其以通读“二十四史”数遍而传为美谈，其国学功底之深厚可见一斑。
本书*初完成于1939年，分为上、下两册，上册分别介绍了我国古代社会的经济、政治和文化发展脉络，内容包括婚姻、族制、政体、阶级、财产、官制、选举、赋税、兵制、刑法、实业、货币、衣食、住行、教育、语文、学术和宗教，共计十八类；下册按照历史朝代的发展顺序，逐一叙述了我国社会的沿承变革。此次本书重新编排为上下编，本书在尽量删繁就简的同时，也在尽量保持原著内容，并且力求在此基础上凸显原著风格，以便为广大读者朋友奉上一道原汁原味的史学大餐。
