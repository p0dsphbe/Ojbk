<p>书名:中老年声乐教程-修订版-(附教学DVD)</p><p>作者:王德安</p><p>页数:213</p><p>定价:¥38.0</p><p>出版社:湖南文艺出版社</p><p>出版日期:2016-11-01</p><p>ISBN:9787540480738</p><p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
　笔者根据自己从事中老年声乐教育近十年的实践，为喜爱唱歌、计划学习或正在学习声乐的中老年朋友编写了这本《中老年声乐教程》。同时，《中老年声乐教程》也可为从事中老年声乐教学的教师们提供一份参考教材。<br/>　　《中老年声乐教程》具有如下几个特点：<br/>　　1.理论性与实践性共立。从发声原理入手，讲授歌唱技巧、歌曲处理、歌唱心理等，深入浅出，着力于歌唱实践。<br/>　　2.系统性与全面性并存。歌唱艺术是一项系统工程，涉及面广，知识性强。《中老年声乐教程》篇幅虽小，但内容翔实。<br/>　　3.规范性与针对性相容。概念求准确、原理求简明、术语求权威、阐述求清晰，并在此基础上紧扣中老年人的心理特点。<br/>　　4.适用性与趣味性相融。一本教材贵在适用，要能突出重点难点，帮助学生找到规律、掌握要领、因此，《中老年声乐教程》每一章的*后都附有通俗易懂、上口有趣的口诀，让柘燥的声乐理论学习在富有情趣的活动中得以巩固。
