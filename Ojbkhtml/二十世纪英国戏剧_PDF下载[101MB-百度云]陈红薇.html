The local publican, Micheal James, allows him to remain as a potboy to safeguard his daughter, Pegeen Mike, while he attends a wake. Pegeen Mike, an attractive, strong-willed, and quick-tempered young woman, falls in love with Christy, much to the indignation of her cousin and would-be suitor Shawn Keogh.

The villagers give up their embrace of Christy, and turn upon their hero despite his offer to "slay his da" a second time. Pegeen leads them in the effort to bring him to due process of the law. Appalled by seeing Pegeen turn on him, Christy escapes from their clutches and tames his bullying father. Then the father and son wander off together from the stage, leaving Pegeen disappointed and protesting in an agony of "Oh my grief, I 're lost him surely. I've lost the only Playboy of the Western World." Even when the play was in rehearsal, Lady Gregory had written to Synge, "I feel we are beginning the</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
