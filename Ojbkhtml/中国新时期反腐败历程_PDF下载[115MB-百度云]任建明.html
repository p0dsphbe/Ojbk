To seek satisfactory ways to prevent and combat corruption, people have made prolonged studies of its causes, as testified by the continuous lengthening of the list of the causes.How numerous they are, the phenomena of corruption can be summarized into the single-cause theories and multiple-cause theories. Single-cause theories, literally attempt to find the sole reason or root cause accounting for corruption, while multiple-cause theories attribute corruption to two or more reasons or causes. Covered in the single-cause theories are the theories of corruption of human nature, power, moral values and culture,as well as corruption in relation to modernization.　　The weaknesses of human nature, such as greed, selfishness,self-interest and insatiability, constitute an important cause for corruption, one that is the earliest known and generally acknowledged. James Madison (1751-1836), the fourth president of the United States, once said, "If men were angels, then no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary." His words reveal a basic fact that men are not angels, they are mortals; they have weaknesses which they are born with. All infamous corrupt officials throughout history are insatiably greedy, revealing to the full the weaknesses of human nature.　　Ferdinand Marcos (1917-1989) was the sixth president of the Philippines. During the 20 years of his presidency (1965 to 1985), Marcos and his wife amassed an appalling amount of wealth. Some people estimated that the wealth of the Marcos fanuly might have reached over ten billion US dollars at one point. After the Marcos couple fled the country in early 1986,the new government immediately ordered the freezing of all of Marcos' assets, and those of his relatives and friends as well. An integrity committee was established to specifically audit Marcos family's assets in the Philippines and abroad. After three years of investigation, the committee determined the wealth of the Marcos family: 4,500 acres of real estate, 5,000 acres of land,23 farms, 232 companies, 18 TV stations, 36 radio stations, 29 auplanes, 13 yachts, one billion US dollars in cash, several tons of gold, and one billion US dollars in jewelry in the Philippines. Additionally, they had four office buildings in Manhattan, New York; villas in Beverly Hills and Honolulu, and 700-million-dollar worth in cash and jewelry in the United States; one billion US dollars in Switzerland; 500 million US dollars in Australia;and at least 300 million US dollars in Brazil. The Marcos family owned a massive number of properties and deposits in Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the Bahamas. Despite the findings, no one knows how many more assets the Marcos family actually possessed. Imelda Marcos' over-the-top luxurious lifestyle shocked and angered the Filipinos. In Imelda's bedroom, expensive French perfumes crowded her toiletry table. She even used a gilt basin to wash her face. There were several hundred articles of expensive　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《中国新时期反腐败历程（英文版）》在阐述腐败和反腐败具有历史性、世界性和复杂性等特点的基础上，对中国共产党对腐败问题的认识深入过程，长期以来在反腐败方面所作的努力，以及在反腐倡廉方面取得的明显成效等进行总结和论述，从而表明中国共产党是立党为公、执政为民的，有信心、有能力解决好腐败问题，提高自身执政能力。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
