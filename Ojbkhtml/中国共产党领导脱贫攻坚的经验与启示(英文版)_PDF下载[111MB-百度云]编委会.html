It discusses achievements and problems, as well as positive experience and misunderstandings. Upon summarizing the issues discovered during this campaign and analyzing their underlying reasons, it lays out the “five experiences” and “four misunderstandings”, with a view to addressing the root causes. It’s a useful reference for countries and regions committed to ending poverty.
—Zhang Shujun, Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, former Deputy Director General and researcher of Party History Research Center of the CPC Central Committee
 
     As a student and researcher of Marxism, I hope the book will reach a wider audience so that readers can be informed of Chinese stores, practices and wisdom in poverty alleviation - latest accomplishments in adapting Marxist anti-poverty theory to the Chinese context. More importantly, I hope that countries and regions committed to eradicating poverty could benefit from it.
—Liu Haitao, Dean and Professor of the Department of Scientific Socialism, Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance)
 
     Since reform and opening up to the outside world, China made achievements in poverty reduction unparalleled in scale in human history, which is widely recognized by the international community. Large-scale poverty reduction in China is closely linked to the governing philosophy, development objectives and action plans of the Communist Party of China. Focusing on practices in targeted poverty alleviation since the 18th CPC National Congress, this book paints a full picture of how the CPC and the Chinese government lead the people to end extreme poverty by ensuring the impoverished population’s access to food, clothing, housing, compulsory education and basic medical services. It’s a great read for those interested in China’s journey and experience in reducing poverty.
—Wang Sangui, adviser to the State Council Leading Group on Poverty Alleviation and Development, and Director of Institute of Chinese Poverty Alleviation, Renmin University of China
 
     The theory and practices of poverty alleviation elaborated in the book point to China’s inevitable path in ending poverty: clear-cut objectives, well-conceived strategies, strong determination, targeted policies, relying on domestic capabilities and continued efforts.
—Yan Shuhan, Lead Researcher of the Marxism Studies and Development Project, and Deputy Director of Center for World Socialism Research, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
