As a result of the developments that have taken place in the PRC over the 70 years， the people of China are living a happier life， the world is more prosperous， and human society is more diverse and colorful.<br/>　　Seventy years ago， under the leadership of the Communist Party of China （CPC） the people of China were emancipated and became masters of their country. Over the subsequent seven decades， the Chinese nation has stood up and grown prosperous and is becoming strong； all basic rights of the people are better respected and protected； and China has made regular contribution to the international cause of human rights.<br/>　　Living a happy life is the primary human right. Since the day of its foundation， the CPC has set its goal to work for the wellbeing of the people of China， for national rejuvenation and for human progress. Since the founding of the PRC， and especially since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012， China has been guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The nation has constantly reviewed the experience gained in human social development， integrated the principle of universality of human rights with national conditions in practicing socialism with Chinese characteristics， and espoused a people-centered view of human rights. China regards the rights to subsistence and development as its primary and basic human rights. It endeavors to improve the rights of all its people in a coordinated manner and works for their rounded development. Both history and present circumstances attest that China has opened a new path of human rights protection based on its national conditions， and increased the diversity of human civilizations.<br/>　　As a key member of the international community， China raises high the banner of peace， development， cooperation， and mutual benefits， stanchly safeguarding world peace， promoting common development， and advancing development through cooperation while promoting human rights through development. It fully participates in global human rights governance， and works strenuously to advance the international cause of human rights.
