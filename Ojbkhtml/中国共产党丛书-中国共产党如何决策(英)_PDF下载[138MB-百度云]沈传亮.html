中国共产党一路走来，从小到大、从弱到强，尤其是改革开放以来，带领中国人民奋勇拼搏，取得举世瞩目的辉煌成就。从根上来看，这与党的有效决策密不可分。本书用“一个导向、六根支柱”的框架结构来阐述党是如何进行有效决策的故事，让国际社会真正了解共产党决策是科学、民主的，尤其是有效、合理的。
The CPC has led the Chinese people to turn an initially economically-weak PRC into the second largest economy in the world. All this is widely held to be the clear result of the CPC’s effective policy making. This book explains how the CPC has developed effective decision-making, and is designed to enable the international community to see how all the decisions made by the CPC in a democratic and reasonable way are genuinely scientific and effective.
