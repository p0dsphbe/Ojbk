<p>书名:《论语》大义浅说-可大可久的生命之学-(上下册)</p><p>作者:姚中秋</p><p>页数:634</p><p>定价:¥68.0</p><p>出版社:中国友谊出版公司</p><p>出版日期:2016-09-01</p><p>ISBN:9787505737693</p><p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
本书以《论语》前十章为上册，后十篇为下册。上、下两册由浅入深、各有主题：上册记孔子其人，彰显孔子兴学以养成士君子之纲目，孔门活泼丰富之气象。下册记孔子与弟子共同行道，呈现重建秩序之构想、实践、心态，展示孔子去世后众弟子思想之丰富多样，可见“和而不同”的气氛。本书既揭示篇章大旨，收各家之说，又以经解经，但不作高深繁复的学术考究，而是直至大义，简捷道出。
                                        </p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>作者认为孔子之学是士君子养成之学；孔子之后，文明在中国之根本就是学，而非神灵崇拜。所以本书揭示的孔子生命状态是悦的、乐的，而非悲的、苦的，它还原了一个温润如玉的孔子形象。作者常以士君子自期，作为当代新儒家的代表，积极致力于良好社会秩序的建立。所以本书不仅讲述了新式“士君子”如何立足于人世，如何自立自强，还特别讨论了儒家王道治理如何应用于现代社会的维新固本之中。
多年前，作者在北京创办了弘道书院，积极投身、实践于传统教育，且颇有深刻而切身的教学体会。所以作者在讲述孔子之教学法、教育内容及孔门众弟子之情态时，真切地写出了师生之情，生动地写出了同门之谊，孔门气象，跃然纸上，十分明朗而饱满。
本书在阐明《论语》大义时，开创性地以西方“神教”与孔子“文教”作东西方文明之比较，系统而详尽的阐发了中国文明之可大可久。本书既收古今各家之精华，统观四书五经之要旨，精准详细地注疏、翻译，但不作高深繁复的学术考究，而是直指大义，简捷道出，语言优美流畅，行文之中不乏精妙语录，常使读者心生“不舍得读完”之情愫。 </p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>姚中秋，笔名秋风，现代新儒学代表人物。现任北京航空航天大学教授、中国弘道书院院长、天则经济研究所理事长。作者横跨儒学、经济学、法学、政治哲学、中外历史等领域，具有广阔的学术视野和强烈的现实感。近年来致力于儒家义理的阐述，中国王道治理的研究。出版译著《法国大革命讲稿》《法律与自由》《哈耶克与古典自由主义》等十余种，出版儒学著作《国史纲目》《现代中国的立国之道》《华夏治理秩序》等。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
