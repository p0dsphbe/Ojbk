Chinese alcoholicdrinks are chiefly made from grain. Throughout the long history of China, withits large population and long-term reliance on agriculture, the ups and downsof the wine trade have been closely bound up with political, economic andsocial conditions. The fluctuations in the grain harvest were like a barometerfor the ups and downs of the wine business. The successive ruling dynastiesissued or relaxed restrictions on wine production according to the grainharvests to make sure that people had enough to live on.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
