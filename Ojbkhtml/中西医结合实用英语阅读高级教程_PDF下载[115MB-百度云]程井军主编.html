It is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis.　　The focus of public health intervention is to improve health and quality of life through the pre-vention and treatment of disease and other physical and mental health conditions, through surveil-lance of cases and health indicators, and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Promotion of hand washing and breastfeeding, delivery of vaccinations, and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases are examples of common public health measures.　　Modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of professionals including physi-cians specializing in public health/community medicine/infectious disease, epidemiologists, biosta-tisticians, public health nurses, medical microbiologists, environmental health officers/public health inspectors, pharmacists, dental hygienists, dietitians and nutritionists, veterinarians, public health engineers, public health lawyers, sociologists, community development workers, communi-cations experts, bioethicists, and others.　　Objectives　　The focus of a public health intervention is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors, communi-tiesand environments. Many diseases are preventable through simple, non-medical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of hand washing with soap can prevent many conta-gious diseases. In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others, such as during an outbreak of infectious disease, or contamination of food or water supplies. Public health communications programs, vaccination programs, and distribution of condoms are examples of common public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy.　　Education and Trairung　　Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Medi-cal Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, Schools of Public Health, and Schools of Pub-lic Affairs. The training typically requires a university degree with a focus on core disciplines of bio-statistics, epidemiology, health services administration, health policy, health education, behavioral science and environmental health. The National Commission for Health Education Credentialing ( NCHEC) offers a national certification, Certified Health Education Specialist, C. H. E. S. , for those who meet the eligibility requirements.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《中西医结合实用英语阅读高级教程》包括27个单元, 重点围绕中西医结合医疗服务展开阅读理解教学。内容涉及中医基础理论、药房、心血管科、呼吸科、消化内科、肿瘤科、泌尿科、血液科、针灸理疗科、内分泌科、精神病科、牙科、眼科、性病科、计划生育科等, 每个单元配有单词</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
