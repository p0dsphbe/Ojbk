  插图：This first round of negotiations resulted in 45,000 tariff concessions affecting $ 10 billion of trade, about one fifth of the world's total. The 23 also agreed that they should accept some of the trade rules of the draft ITO Charter.  This, they believed, should be done swiftly and "provisionally" in order to protect the value of the tariff concessions they had negotiated. The combined package of trade rules and tariff concessions became known as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It entered into force in January 1948, while the ITO Charter was still being negotiated. The 23 became founding GATT members (officially, "contracting parties ").ITO aborted and GATT became provisionalAlthough the ITO Charter was finally agreed at a UN Conference on Trade and Employment in Havana in March 1948, ratification in some national legislatures proved impossible. The most serious opposition was in the US Congress, even though the US government had been one of the driving forces. In 1950, the United States government announced that it would not seek congressional ratification of the Havana Charter, and the/TO was effectively dead.  Even though it was provisional, the GATT remained the only multilateral instrument governing international trade from 1948 until the WTO was established in 1995.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
