　　The people are the foundation of a country； food is the pri-mary need of the people. As food decides national prosperity and the people's wellbeing， food security is a major prerequi-site for national security. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China （PRC） in 1949， China has always prioritized food security in state governance. Despite a weak agricultural foundation and extreme poverty， the Communist Party of China （CPC） has led an unremitting campaign of hard work over the past 70 years that has made China basically self-sufficient in food supply. China now has enough food to feed its nearly 1.4 billion population， and has remarkably improved the people's nutrition and life quality. China's food security is a success of worldwide significance.　　The people are the foundation of a country； food is the pri-mary need of the people.

China now has enough food to feed its nearly 1.4 billion population， and has remarkably improved the people's nutrition and life quality. China's food security is a success of worldwide significance.<br/>　　Since the CPC's 18th National Congress in 2012， the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as its core has treated food security as a top state issue. The central leadership has intro-duced a food security policy of "ensuring basic self-sufficiency of grain and absolute security of staple food". The Chinese government has established a national strategy on food security featuring self-sufficiency based on domestic grain production，guaranteed food production capacity， moderate imports， and technological support. Abiding by the principle of basic food self-sufficiency based on domestic grain production， China practices the strictest farmland protection system and a strategy of sustainable farmland use and innovative application of agri-cultural technology to increase farmland productivity. Through supply-side structural reform and institutional innovation in ag-riculture， China has raised grain productivity， modernized grain circulation， improved food-supply structure， and achieved steady development in the grain industry. Step by step， China has established a food security guarantee system at a very high level characterized by quality， efficiency and sustainability.China's food security has a stronger guarantee， along a steadier and wider path with Chinese  aracteristics.
