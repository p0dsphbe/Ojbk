I．Introduction<br/>
     In June, 2007, leading climate scientists issued a report concluding that the<br/>
Earth is in "imminent peril  "(i)They warn that runaway climate heating will impose<br/>
catastrophic conditions on generations to come. It threatens to destroy major plane-<br/>
tary fixtures, including the polar ice sheets, Greenland, the coral reefs, and the<br/>
Amazon forest. It will bring floods, hurricanes, heat waves, fires, disease, crop<br/>
losses, food shortages, droughts, and cause extinctions of up to 70% of the world's<br/>
species.   It could kill millions of Earth's citizens, force massive human refugee<br/>
migrations, and pose an unending threat to world security. In the words of leading<br/>
scientists, our continued carbon pollution will cause a "transformed planet. " <br/>
      The world has only a narrow window of time to begin reversing global emis-<br/>
 sions of carbon before our planet passes a "tipping point" whereby dangerous feed-<br/>
back loops will unravel the planet's climate system--despite any subsequent carbon<br/>
reductions achieved by Humanity. Many climate scientists now warn that continued<br/>
use of coal will destroy the very conditions that have supported human civilization<br/>
for the last 10,000 years.<br/>
     As nations enter a new chapter in climate negotiations, they search for a<br/>
framework of international obligation that is clear, compelling, and responsive to<br/>
the urgency facing the world, yet one that can build upon the United Nations<br/>
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) signed in 1992. A deeply<br/>
rooted principle manifest in most countries of the world provides the beacon for<br/>
such a framework. Under the public trust doctrine, the atmosphere is a natural as-<br/>
set that all nations share as common property. All nations are "trustees" with a<br/>
duty to protect  the atmosphere for present and future generations.<br/>
      United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon has called upon the United<br/>
States and China--the world's two biggest polluters--to take bold action to reduce<br/>
carbon.    This article urges a partnership between China and the United States in<br/>
which the two nations join as sovereign trustees of the atmosphere to lead the world<br/>
in an urgent energy transformation on the scale of the Industrial Revolution. It pro-<br/>
poses a world-wide moratorium against coal development, and recovery of natural<br/>
resource damages from private corporations that have polluted the atmosphere with<br/>
greenhouse gases. Such damages should be used for immediate investment into al-<br/>
teruative energy systems and technology for the developing nations as partial com-<br/>
pensation for their disproportionate conservation burden.<br/>
      Part II of this article describes the threat of global warming. Part III confronts<br/>
the reality that coal is no longer a viable long-term source of fuel. Part IV presents<br/>
the trust obligation that defines government's responsibility to protect the atmos-<br/>
phere. Part V brings this trust responsibility within the UNFCCC framework. Part<br/>
VI proposes world-wide moratorium against coal development and recovery of natu-<br/>
ral resource damages for atmospheric pollution.<br/>
