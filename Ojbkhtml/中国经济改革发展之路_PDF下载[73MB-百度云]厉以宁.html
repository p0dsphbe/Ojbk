  Economic disequilibrium in the second category is characterized by an incomplete market and inflexible prices, and more importantly, by a market filled with microeconomic agents that, instead of being independent commodity producers making their own business decisions and bearing their own gains and losses, neither have the freedom to choose investment opportunities and management modes nor bear the responsibility for investment and management risks. Such microeconomic agents have not shaken off their status as government subsidiaries or are bound hand and foot by their pre-capitalist ties.If my division of economic disequilibrium stands, there is reason to believe that the disequilibrium in a capitalist economy belongs in the firstcategory and that the disequilibrium in a pre-capitalist economy belongs in the second category. What happens in a socialist economy should be treated differently. Disequilibrium under a traditional and dual-track economic system falls into the second category because its enterprises have yet to shake off their status as government subsidiaries. Under the new economic system born of economic reform, enterprises become independent commodity producers that make their own investment and business decisions, and are liable for their gains, losses as well as investment and business risks. Thusthe disequilibrium in the new economic system falls into the first category.In the first category of disequilibrium, microeconomic agents are fullof vitality. However, these microeconomic agents are in an economic disequilibrium. They make transactions in incomplete markets where pricesare inflexible and information is incomplete and congested. Therefore, suchvitality is limited by this environment. For instance, price rigidity makes it hard for these agents to adjust production in response to price signals, and wage rigidity also prevents them from optimizing their resource allocations. However, a microeconomic agent that has full vitality but is circumscribed by its environment is very different from a microeconomic agent that lacks Mfull vitality. This is exactly the difference between the first and second categories of disequilibrium.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>

  《中国经济改革发展之路》：Economic restructuring may break down if price reform fails. Thesuccess of economic restructuring, however, hinges not on pricereform, but on ownership reform, which entails revamping the corpo-rate system. This is because price reform serves the main purpose ofshaping an environment in favor of the growth of the market economy,but only ownership reform or corporate system reform can addresssuch issues as interests, responsibility, motivation, and incentives.Li Yining
