The author believes that ancient Chinese myths and legends were gradually formed on the basis of those of the Huaxia (Han) and by absorbing from the Dongyi (ancient eastern tribes) and the Miaoman (ancient Southern tribes).The author sorted materials from various ancient Chinese books and records,and arranged the myths in order to aid readers' appreciation of the materials.In some chapters, he compares Chinese myths with western ones (especiallythe Greek).<br/>Full of fascinating material sand lucidly written, this book enables readers toenjoy the charm of Chinese myths and legends as well understand the spiritof traditional Chinese culture. In addition to the main Chinese traditions, the author includes reference to less well-known but equally fascinating stories.<br/>
